### 🏋️Preparation
This demo is designed to be run in a development container for easy setup. The container includes the following:
- PostgresSQL dataset for Zava
- **Customer Sales Server** that does basic product search using traditional name-based matching
- A web app of the Cora agent app

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- Azure AI Foundry project with a **GPT-4o** model deployment
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

**Open the repository in the dev container**

1. Open **Docker Desktop**.
1. Fork and clone this repository in Visual Studio Code.
1. When prompted by Visual Studio Code, select to "Reopen in Container". Alternatively, open the **Command Palette** (i.e. CTRL/CMD+Shift+P) and enter **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
1. Wait for the setup to complete. The dev container will build automatically with all dependencies pre-installed. This includes PostgresSQL with pgvector extension, a Python environment, and all required packages.


> **Note**: Check if postgres database is populated, if not run the following commands in the terminal: ``chmod +x scripts/init-db.sh``

**Confirm extensions are installed**

Confirm that the dev container has installed the following extensions:
- [Azure Resources](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [AI Toolkit](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit)

If any extension is missing, install before moving forward.

*Note: The [Azure AI Foundry](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry) extension is installed as a bundle with the AI Toolkit*.

**Sign-in to the Azure Resources extension and set your default project.**

1. In the **Azure Resources** extension, select **Sign in to Azure**.
1. Sign-in to the account that has your Azure AI Foundry project and GPT-4o deployed model.
1. Open the **Azure AI Foundry** extension (*note: the Azure AI Foundry extension comes installed with the AI Toolkit*).
1. Under the **Resources** section, confirm whether your Azure AI Foundry project is set as the default project. The default project displays under **Resources** with a **Default** label.
1. If your project is **not** set as the default project, hover over the project name and click the **Switch Default Project in Azure Extension** icon (*note: the icon looks like 3 lines*).
1. In the **Pick a project** window, select the subscription that has your Azure AI Foundry project.
1. In the **Pick a project** window, select your Azure AI Foundry project.

**Setup environment variables**
1. In the terminal, run the command: `cp .env.example .env`
1. Open your new `.env` file.
1. Enter your `AZURE_AI_API_KEY="<your_Azure_AI_API_key>"` (note: The **Key** in the **Endpoint** section for your model deployment )
1. Enter your `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT="<your_Azure_AI_endpoint>"` (note: The **Target URI** in the Endpoint section for your model deployment up until the deployment name; ex: https://{your-custom-endpoint}-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o)

**Start the Customer Sales Server**

1. Create a **.vscode/mcp.json** file.
1. Add the following content to the **.vscode/mcp.json** file:
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "zava-sales-analysis-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/mcp_server/sales_analysis/sales_analysis.py",
                "--stdio",
                "--RLS_USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            ]
        },
        "zava-customer-sales-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/mcp_server/customer_sales/customer_sales.py",
                "--stdio",
                "--RLS_USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            ]
        },
        "zava-customer-sales-semantic-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/mcp_server/customer_sales/customer_sales_semantic_search.py",
                "--stdio",
                "--RLS_USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            ]
        },
        "zava-diy-http": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp",
            "type": "http"
        }
    },
    "inputs": []
}
```

1. Click **Start** above the **zava-customer-sales-stdio** server.

**Start the Cora web app**

1. In the terminal, run the command `python src/web_app/app.py`.
1. In the browser, navigate to [htts://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
1. Confirm that the green **Connected** label displays in the top-right of the UI.
